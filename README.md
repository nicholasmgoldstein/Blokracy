# Blokracy
Blokracy â€” A Public Voting Smart Contract. Developed using Solidity. Blokracy is designed to create ballots for other users to vote on. Ballots are loaded by their unique ID or recency. Users can load ballots and then vote on them, allowing Blokracy to maintain a democratic ecosystem. Administrative functions allow the initializer of the smart contract to delete ballots.
